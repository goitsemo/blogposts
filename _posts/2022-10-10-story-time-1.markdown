<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap"></span>My high school girlfriend died in a accident on the closing day of my final term of Grade 12, I would call her phone number as a coping mechanism. I left her messages, updating her on my life, how I was coping with her loss, and how much I really missed her. The thing is, I was really hurting and sometimes I wouldn't survive the pain.</p>



Hell, I even tried to call her phone number when my results came out, wanting to tell her how I cleared.

Eventually, the number fell out of service. I still called around her birthday, the anniversary of our first date at the school grounds and I tried to call on Christmas Eve. She loved Christmas. Once or twice, after I’d gone to university and the excitement of new life there overtook me, I would forget these milestone dates and not call. I really felt guilty the first few times but that diminished as life ticked on.

The night before my wedding I called one last time, hoping to say goodbye and leave everything behind me. To move on.

It actually rang. My blood ran cold.
I answered.

"H— hello?"

“Yange, you're not leaving me, are you?”
