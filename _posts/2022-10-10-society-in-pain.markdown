<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap"></span>Our society is in pain!, men are culprits of GBV. As much as women are involved but are in the minority. I've been counseling men and women for a long time and can tell u that most men are in pain caused by women they love. It's a fact..</p>

GBV is caused by men,  and women cause men to commit suicide. It's a general statement but it's factual in our society. However it doesn't mean that only women cause men to commit suicide and not all men are involved in GBV.

Men are in pain and women are also in pain.

How do we solve this?
Over 800 women have been killed from March till now in SA and almost 200 kids have been killed as well.

Men are committing suicide mostly as a result of being involved with women.

There are men who vowed not to marry again because of the wife's or woman's wound.

There are also women who don't want to marry due to man's or husband's wound.

Let's fix this societal pandemic.
